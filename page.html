            <br>It was almost twilight, I was heading to my house on my bicycle to get some food into my starving stomach. Oh, man! I forgot to introduce myself. I am Asphalt and as you don't know how I look, I am skinny and I have messy brown hair with electric blue eyes. I am no one to say but I am very good at science, math and Greek mythology. I am a green belt martial artist too. I am twelve years old and I live in England with my two friends. We all live together as a family. This might be shocking but we all are orphans, yes you read it correctly ‘orphans’. The city we live in has a small population that's why people do not investigate us. My friends' names are Patrick and Leo. Patrick is very skinny, he has jet black hair and he is very smart. Leo is also very thin but he has smooth messy blonde hair. Leo is very good at his reflexes and he is even good at studies. Patrick is very skilled in many physical activities. It's our daily routine to race home

        <p class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-6 page" id="page2">
            <br>and grab our food, we have less food that's why whoever reaches home first gets more of it. As the saying goes, “The early bird gets the worm."
            <br><br>So where were we, got it, I am just a turn away when suddenly 2 bicycles join me. They were my friends, Leo and Patrick, we rode fast together to beat each other home when suddenly from the corner a car appeared. We were about to crash when instantly out of nowhere a mysterious circle appeared in front of us. All of us stopped and exchanged confused glances and then we looked around, it was neither day nor night it was like the eclipse. We also saw an old man wearing a robe, he looked like a wise wizard but you know wizards are not real just like all the other mythical creatures such as the Phoenix and Griffins. The wizard looking person suddenly looked at us, a grin slid onto his face and said in a deep old voice “I knew you would come, I knew this is your destiny.” In a confused tone, I asked “Where are we? How do you know that this is my destiny? I have just come here by accident. And by the way who are you?”
